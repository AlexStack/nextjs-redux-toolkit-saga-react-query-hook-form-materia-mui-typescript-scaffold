When we build web applications, we build independent, reusable components. Then we use all these components to build a complex UI. Every react application has one root component. This root component has child components and an internal application. so every react application is a tree of components.<br>\nFor example, if we take the FB page as a web application project, we split this application into components like Navbar, Feed, and profile,  so the feed component has several child components such as like, share components, and these are reusable components which means you can use these components in somewhere else or sometimes in different applications. </p>\n\n<p>Component implemented as a javascript <code>class</code>, and some <code>state</code>, <code>render</code> method.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>`State` is the data we want to display when the component is rendered.\n\n`Render method` is responsible for describing how UI should look like.\n\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"highlight__panel js-actions-panel\">\n<div class=\"highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action\">\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-on\"><title>Enter fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M16 3h6v6h-2V5h-4V3zM2 3h6v2H4v4H2V3zm18 16v-4h2v6h-6v-2h4zM4 19h4v2H2v-6h2v4z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-off\"><title>Exit fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M18 7h4v2h-6V3h2v4zM8 9H2V7h4V3h2v6zm10 8v4h-2v-6h6v2h-4zM8 15v6H6v-4H2v-2h6z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>The output of the render method is a react element, which is a simple JS object mapped to a virtual-DOM element. When we change the state of a component, then we get a new react element. Then will compare this element and its children with the previous one to find out the changed one, and it will update in the real DOM to keep it synchronized with the virtual DOM. </p>\n\n<p>That means when building applications with reactJS, unlike <code>Jquery</code> and <code>vanilla JS,</code> we no longer have to work with DOM API in browsers.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"realtime-environment\" href=\"#realtime-environment\">\n  </a>\n  Real-time Environment\n</h3>\n\n<p>Let's build the basic configurations for creating react applications in real time.</p>\n\n<p>Go to your terminal and run the below command.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>create-react-app &lt;name of the app&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"highlight__panel js-actions-panel\">\n<div class=\"highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action\">\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-on\"><title>Enter fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M16 3h6v6h-2V5h-4V3zM2 3h6v2H4v4H2V3zm18 16v-4h2v6h-6v-2h4zM4 19h4v2H2v-6h2v4z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-off\"><title>Exit fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M18 7h4v2h-6V3h2v4zM8 9H2V7h4V3h2v6zm10 8v4h-2v-6h6v2h-4zM8 15v6H6v-4H2v-2h6z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>It will automatically install react and all other third-party libraries we need.

They made it open source in 2013. React is one of the most used JS libraries to create web-based applications.\nThe DOM updates can be managed with ease by React. It's a lightweight and speedy library for implementing JS applications with scalability and reusable code. It uses less memory to keep the representation of virtual DOM elements.\n\nLet me introduce the vocabulary in the javascript world.\n\n\n### What are .JS and .JSX files?\n\nJavaScript code is included in JS (JavaScript) files, which run JavaScript on web pages. The `.Js` extension is used to hold JavaScript files. If the JS file has the HTML code and Javascript code, it's called `.JSX` (JS XML files or JS HTML files.)\n\n\n### React -DOM?\n\nIn order to provide an effective approach to controlling DOM components of the web page, ReactDOM is a package that offers DOM-specific functions that can be used at the top level of a web application. \n\nThe following methodsÂ are available in ReactDOM's API for developers.\n* render()\n* findDOMNode()\n* unmountComponentAtNode()\n* hydrate()\n* createPortal()\n\n### Babel\n\nA JavaScript transpiler called BabelJS converts new features into out-of-date standards. This makes it simple to use the functionalities on both outdated and modern browsers. Sebastian McKenzie, an Australian programmer, founded BabelJS.\n\nWe require a program that will build our final code in ES5 if we want to leverage new ECMA Script capabilities and run it on any accessible browser.\n\nThe same thing is done by Babel, which is referred to as a transpiler that transpiles the code into the desired ECMA Script version.\n\n\n### COMPONENTS\n\nThe vital part of the `React` application is `components.` a component is a piece of (UI) user interface. When we build web applications, we build independent, reusable components. Then we use all these components to build a complex UI. Every react application has one root component. This root component has child components and an internal application. so every react application is a tree of components.\nFor example, if we take the FB page as a web application project, we split this application into components like Navbar, Feed, and profile,  so the feed component has several child components such as like, share components, and these are reusable components which means you can use these components in somewhere else or sometimes in different applications. \n\nComponent implemented as a javascript `class`, and some `state`, `render` method.\n\n```\n`State` is the data we want to display when the component is rendered.\n\n`Render method` is responsible for describing how UI should look like.\n\n```\nThe output of the render method is a react element, which is a simple JS object mapped to a virtual-DOM element. When we change the state of a component, then we get a new react element. Then will compare this element and its children with the previous one to find out the changed one, and it will update in the real DOM to keep it synchronized with the virtual DOM. \n\n\nThat means when building applications with reactJS, unlike `Jquery` and `vanilla JS,` we no longer have to work with DOM API in browsers.\n\n\n### Real-time Environment\n\n\nLet's build the basic configurations for creating react applications in real time.\n\nGo to your terminal and run the below command.\n\n```\ncreate-react-app <name of the app>\n```\n\nIt will automatically install react and all other third-party libraries we need.
