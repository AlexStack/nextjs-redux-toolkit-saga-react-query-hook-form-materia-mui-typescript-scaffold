And one of the most effective digital marketing techniques is link building.</p>\n\n<p>If you are bootstrapping your product, a question like this will arise: *<em>\"Can I just pitch my business everywhere or buy backlinks for pennies from high-volume resellers?\" *</em>. Huh, if everything were that simple, SEO agencies wouldn't exist. </p>\n\n<p>To get your domain authority (DA) growing, you need to get featured by websites with a higher domain authority than yours. DA is a metric defined on a scale from 0 to 100. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Compare your company website DA with a target website DA using free website authority checkers by <a href=\"https://ahrefs.com/backlink-checker\">Ahrefs</a> or <a href=\"https://moz.com/domain-analysis\">Moz</a>. If the target website DA is higher than yours, that's a go-ahead signal to submit your startup there.</li>\n<li>Another vital factor to consider is topical similarity. It means you want to get backlinks from websites that are relevant to your niche. If you sell a SaaS product for developers, backlinks from cooking blogs will get you nowhere, despite a higher DA and decent traffic volume.\nWhile there's more to it, this should suffice to choose from business media and startup ranking directories featured in our list.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"top-websites-to-submit-your-startup\" href=\"#top-websites-to-submit-your-startup\">\n  </a>\n  Top Websites to Submit Your Startup\n</h2>\n\n<p>Here is a sneak peek of the startup directories that made it to our list.

The next step was to exclude the ones with low DA and SEO potential.\n\n![Details about the list for submitting a startup](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3p9k0f3bzpx7jvs6vj89.jpg)\n\nTo enrich my brand-new list of startup directories, I took the following data points into account:\n\n- How long does it take to submit your startup?\n- Is the directory free or paid?\n- How difficult is submitting your startup here?\n- Moz Domain Authority (DA)\n- Traffic volume\n- The top country in terms of website traffic\n- Website type (media, directory, forum, etc.)\n- Website's core topic\n- Trust and Citation Flow scores\n\n**The icing on the cake is the startup directory filtering.** With this list, you can filter all the data according to your business needs and focus on directories that fit your product criteria.\n\n## Things to Consider Before Submitting Your Startup\nAfter conducting market research, creating a team, and building an MVP comes the most challenging part of the startup lifecycle: promoting your SaaS product online, successfully showcasing your services to your audience, and getting the first users.\n\nThis list of websites to submit your startup is made to help you bring new products in front of early adopters or investors and improve your website authority by increasing exposure.\n\nBefore you promote your company in the media, let's cover the basics so you can decide which submission websites are a good fit and which are worth skipping.\n\n### What is Website Authority and Why is it Essential?\nGoogle algorithm is an extensive, complex beast. There are likely thousands of ranking factors, and the list keeps growing.\n\nIt would help if you gained Google's trust (aka authority) to get more search traffic in the long run. And one of the most effective digital marketing techniques is link building.\n\nIf you are bootstrapping your product, a question like this will arise: **\"Can I just pitch my business everywhere or buy backlinks for pennies from high-volume resellers?\" **. Huh, if everything were that simple, SEO agencies wouldn't exist. \n\nTo get your domain authority (DA) growing, you need to get featured by websites with a higher domain authority than yours. DA is a metric defined on a scale from 0 to 100. \n\n1. Compare your company website DA with a target website DA using free website authority checkers by [Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/backlink-checker) or [Moz](https://moz.com/domain-analysis). If the target website DA is higher than yours, that's a go-ahead signal to submit your startup there.\n2. Another vital factor to consider is topical similarity. It means you want to get backlinks from websites that are relevant to your niche. If you sell a SaaS product for developers, backlinks from cooking blogs will get you nowhere, despite a higher DA and decent traffic volume.\nWhile there's more to it, this should suffice to choose from business media and startup ranking directories featured in our list.\n\n## Top Websites to Submit Your Startup\nHere is a sneak peek of the startup directories that made it to our list. The following platforms should give you an idea of the quality I kept in mind while creating the directory list.
