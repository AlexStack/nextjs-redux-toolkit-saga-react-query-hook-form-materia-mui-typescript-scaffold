Serverless means that if a server crashes at 3:54 am, it’s not your problem.\n\n## How Lambda Works\n\n- **The Deployment:** Deploying a function is as simple as configuring it in a container. In the event that the function is a package with dependencies, it must first be zipped and uploaded to an S3 bucket. AWS is the step's active character. So that the developer can concentrate on their code, AWS builds the container, configures it, and manages it.\n    \n    AWS creates an instance, which is a container made from Amazon Linux AMIs (Amazon Machine Images) that has a configurable runtime of 1–900 seconds, a RAM range of 128MB–10240 MB, and temporary storage ranging from 512MB–10GB.\n\n\n\n![How AWS Lambda works](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/utbneh8nvpruut52mral.jpg)\n    \n- **The Event:** The function you write should be set to trigger an event. It might be a simple SMS or call, a fire alarm, or both, but it needs to cause stimuli.\n    \n    You don't have access to any infrastructure resources that would let you take control of the cloud infrastructure because serverless computing helps to abstract it.\n    \n- **The Operations involved:** Only when the event is triggered will your code run, and only during the time-span of the runtime will payments be made. This specific feature is advantageous for Lambda users who wish to use Lambda to provision back-end services prompted by HTTP requests (for example), as it preserves resources when not in use. As a result, since you only pay for the compute time you actually use when using Lambda, cost is almost never an issue.\n\nIn addition to being entirely event-driven, Lambda also conducts autonomous vertical scaling.
