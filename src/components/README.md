# What's this folder used for?

**components** folder files save react small components used throughout the application.

- Components are the building blocks of any react project. This folder consists of a collection of UI components like buttons, modals, inputs, loader, etc., that can be used across various files in the project. Each component should consist of a test file to do a unit test as it will be widely used in the project.
