# What's this folder used for?

**apis** folder files save CLIENT SIDE API functions(e.g. code snippets for React Query) used throughout the application.

- The api directory contains all services that take care of the communication between the React application (frontend) and an API (backend). A single service provides multiple functions to retrieve data from or post data to an external service using the HTTP protocol.

## Example files

- axios.tx
- auth-api.tx
- article-api.tx
