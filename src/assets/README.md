# What's this folder used for?

**assets** folder files save assets used throughout the application.

- it contains assets of our project. It consists of images and styling files. Here we can store our global styles. We are centralizing the project so we can store the page-based or component-based styles over here. But we can even keep style according to the pages folder or component folder also. But that depends on developer conformability.
